# Overview

An implementation for Red-Black Tree, a type of self-balancing binary search tree. The program allows the user to insert, delete, and search for elements in the tree, and also provides an option to print the tree in a visual format.

# Compiling the program
Use the command "make" to compile the program. This will create one executable, "rbtree".

# Running the program
To run the "rbtree" executable, use the command:

`./rbtree


# Usage
rbtree provides the following options:

* Insert a new element into the tree
* Delete an existing element from the tree
* Print the tree in a visual format
* The program will prompt the user for input and provide feedback on the results of each operation.

* The structure of the code is based on the description of red-black tree in "Introduction to Algorithms" by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein.
* The visualization of the tree is inspired by the implementation in "Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis in C" by Mark Allen Weiss.
